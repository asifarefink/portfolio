                <h3>Early Years</h3>
                <p>I was born in Barishal on January 14, 2002. From a young age, I nurtured a dream of becoming a
                    valuable asset to society. As I grew older and discovered the world of engineering, I realized that
                    this field was my true calling. The idea of solving real-world problems, innovating, and
                    contributing to technological advancements inspired me. With this passion, I set my sights on
                    becoming an engineer—one who not only excels in the field but also makes a meaningful impact on the
                    world. </p>

                <h3>High School & College Life</h3>
                <p>My academic journey took me to Dhaka Residential Model College, where I spent my high school and
                    college years. Those years shaped not only my education but also my character. The institution
                    provided me with a strong academic foundation, instilled discipline, and fueled my curiosity. It was
                    there that I honed my analytical thinking, developed resilience, and cultivated the ambition to
                    pursue engineering.

                    Beyond academics, I explored my passions for music, programming, and leadership. Music became a
                    creative outlet, allowing me to express myself beyond logic and equations. Programming, on the other
                    hand, opened up a world of problem-solving and innovation, reinforcing my love for technology.
                    Additionally, my leadership experiences—whether in group projects, student activities, or guiding my
                    peers—helped me develop confidence, teamwork skills, and the ability to inspire others.

                    With every challenge and achievement, my passion for technology, innovation, and personal growth
                    grew stronger, solidifying my resolve to contribute meaningfully to the world as an engineer.</p>

                <h3>University Life</h3>
                <p>Currently, I am pursuing my studies at RUET, where I am diving deeper into my passion for
                    electronics. The field of electronics fascinates me with its ever-evolving nature and the endless
                    possibilities it offers to create innovative solutions for real-world problems. As I continue to
                    expand my knowledge, I am excited by the potential to contribute to the advancement of technology.

                    In addition to my technical pursuits, I am also focused on learning different language skills. In
                    today’s interconnected world, adaptability is key. By improving my communication skills and learning
                    new languages, I aim to broaden my horizons, connect with diverse cultures, and stay agile in the
                    modern age. This blend of technical expertise and cultural adaptability is shaping me into a
                    well-rounded individual ready to tackle the challenges of the future.</p>

                <h3>Where I Am Now</h3>
                <p>I am currently in my 3rd year at RUET, where I am fully dedicated to learning and achieving
                    everything within my reach. This period of my life is one of intense growth, both academically and
                    personally, as I strive to absorb all the knowledge and skills that will shape my future.

                    Alongside my studies, I am working on an exciting project involving a GSM and GPS-based accident
                    prevention and detection vehicle. This project aims to enhance road safety by using advanced
                    technology to detect accidents in real time and send emergency alerts, potentially saving lives. It
                    allows me to apply my theoretical knowledge in electronics while addressing real-world problems.

                    With a clear vision in mind, I am also focused on expanding my horizons and looking towards
                    opportunities abroad. Whether it’s further studies, internships, or collaborations, I believe
                    international exposure will broaden my perspectives and provide the platform to enhance my skills.
                    My goal is not only to excel in my field but to gain global experience that will allow me to
                    contribute to the world in a meaningful way.</p>
